# Semester Project for CS39AA
## Author: Brady
## Semester: Fall 2023

I always enjoy working with data as far removed from useful real-world applications as possible. So I find myself asking the question, can we use pokedex entries to predict the typing of a pokemon? I find this idea very interesting as pokedex entries typically aren't long but typically contain pretty important key words that I believe will be good indicators of typing. Pokemon also tend to have multiple types (up to two), so this becomes a more interesting problem as we're now predicting the values of two separate columns and we can't have duplicates! 

Some will be easy, like Bulbasaur mentioning that it has a plant like bulb on its back, but I doubt all will be that straightforward. 

This project will not be using LLMs due to the scope of the class material, though better results are almost guaranteed by going that route.
